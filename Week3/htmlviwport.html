	<p>
		A Browser's viewport is the area of the web page in which the content 
        is visible to the user. The viewport does not have the same size, it 
        varies with the variation in screen size of the devices on which the 
        website is visible. For a laptop, the viewport has a larger size as 
        compared to a smartphone or tablet.
        Note: When a page is not made responsive for smaller viewports it 
        looks bad or even breaks on a smaller screen. To fix this problem 
        introduce a responsive tag to control the viewport. This tag was first 
        introduced by Apple Inc. for Safari iOS.
